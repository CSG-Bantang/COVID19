This is a repository of our effortst to contribute to understanding the COVID19 in the Country. 
Our Team consists mostly of the members of the Complex Systems Group -- Bantang (CSG-Bantang) at the Instrumentation Physics Laboratory (IPL) at the National Institute of Physics (NIP), College of Science, University of the Philippines.

## Our objective is three-fold:

1. Provide overview of the dynamical properties of COVID19 in PH
2. Analyze spatio-temporal scenario cases according to possible imposition of rules (ECQ)
3. Learn as a scientist improving on our work ethics as personal development and learn new skills for professional development.
4. Please upload all codes here without uploading any dataset in this repository.

As we adhere to free and open-source scientific enterprise, all our codes are under CC-BY-SA 3.0.
However, as a matter of scientific prudence, we shall wait for publication of the same before we actively share all our results.

Let's fight!
